# Insurgency Weapons

This mod adds "realistic" guns with "realistic" mechanics like actual magazine size and reloading. 
All of the guns are held projectiles so if you use some mod that changes how projectiles work you might have some unwanted bugs.

All enemies now drop "money" at a fixed 50% chance, with money you can craft the vending machines for weapons and ammo.
Bind the key in the config screen if you want the ability to manually reload the guns. You can also buy ammo anywhere but it costs 20% more to do so when compared to buying the ammo at the vending machine.
